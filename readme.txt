This repository came up as a result of an issue with one of the glassware company in Turkey. They called Karaca Züccaciye A.Ş.
The story is purely depends on an item which is send to warranty to be repaired however they did not return it even though three months passed.
I tried to reach them but could not achieved it, because they are forwarding me stupid automated message responder.
Since I do not want to deal with sending messages manually, I wrote a small script which does it for me automatically using Selenium library.
Now it is sending mail on behalf of me. I will stop this automation when I received concurrent respond from them.
Until that time, I will make sure that this repository is running successfully.

Updates regarding to situation will come ....
