This repository came up as a result of an issue with one of the glassware company (-Karaca Züccaciye A.Ş.-) in Turkey.
The story is purely depends on an item which is send to warranty to be repaired.
However they did not return it even though three months passed.
I tried to reach them but could not achieved it, because they are forwarding me stupid automated message responder.
Since I do not want to deal with sending messages manually, I wrote a small script.
Now it is sending mail on behalf of me. I will stop this automation when I received concurrent respond from them.
Until that time, I will make sure that this repository is running successfully.

Updates regarding to situation will come ....
