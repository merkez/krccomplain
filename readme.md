<sub>This repository came up as a result of an issue with one of the glassware[1] company in Turkey.</sub><sub>The story is purely depends on an item which is send to warranty to be repaired.</sub><sub>However they did not return it even though three months passed.I tried to reach them but could not achieved it, because they are forwarding me stupid automated message responder.</sub> <sub>Since I do not want to deal with sending messages manually, I wrote a small script.Now it is sending mail on behalf of me. I will stop this automation when I received concurrent respond from them.Until that time, I will make sure that this repository is running successfully.</sub>

<sub><b>Update 1</b> </sub>

<sub> They contacted with me over an email by sending a service ticket which contains statement of refund. However, my point is to get the product instead of refund, which means that this repo will continuously send emails to KRC  </sub>


<sub><b>Update 2</b> </sub>


<sub> Eventually, they explicitly wrote that I need to contact with seller instead of contacting with them. Luckily seller is Amazon, so I have contacted with seller and they refund me however the price that I bought it was three times less than its price currently. The seller pointed out that when product is in stock, they will refund the difference to me. (new price - old price) will be re-refunded. </sub>



<sub><b>It seems that this is the end of the story, at least for time being. I can say that this automated way of sending complain messages helped me to conclude the situation. If I knew this is required, I would do it just right after sending the product to Karaca. Instead waited four months to get a reply, however they did not give a shit, so I decided to send same email daily. At the end, even though I am not satisfied with the result, I received a reply. </b></sub>

<sub> The final result is basically receiving a refund for the product. :|  </sub>
